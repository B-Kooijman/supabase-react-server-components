# React Server Components Demo `with Prisma`

This is a fork of the awesome [React Server Components Demo](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo).
We replaced `pg` with `@prisma/client` and for ease of use, we replaced Postgres with SQLite, so you don't need to setup any database.
To run this, just follow these steps:

## Usage
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This demo features an experimental package, [`react-prisma`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-prisma).
